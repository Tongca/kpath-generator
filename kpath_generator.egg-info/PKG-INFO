# kpath-generator

A **strictly AFLOW-compliant** high-symmetry k-path generator for
phonon and electronic band-structure calculations.

## Features
- Automatic crystal family detection
- Identical k-paths for:
  - Phonopy
  - Quantum ESPRESSO (bands.x)
  - ALAMODE
- Based on SeeK-path (HPKOT)
- Optional k-path visualization

## Installation

```bash
pip install kpath-generator
